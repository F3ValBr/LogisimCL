<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>
    The comparator checks the relation between two multi-bit values
    (greater than, equal, less than). The comparison is performed bit by bit,
    starting from the most significant bit and descending in parallel until
    a position is found where the two values differ.
</p>

<p>
    Normally, exactly one of the three outputs will be <code>1</code> and the
    remaining two will be <code>0</code>. If, during the descent, an error
    value or a floating value is encountered, then all three outputs adopt
    that error or floating value.
</p>

<p>
    The <q>Strict Equality</q> attribute refines the behaviour of the
    equality output (<code>=</code>):
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>No (default):</strong> the component behaves as in the
        original version of Logisim; any undefined or floating bits in the
        inputs cause the three outputs to become unknown or floating.</li>
    <li><strong>Yes:</strong> the equality output is evaluated even in the
        presence of undefined bits. If both operands are completely
        undefined, the equality output is driven to <code>1</code>; if they
        differ at any defined position, the equality output is <code>0</code>.
        The greater-than and less-than outputs keep the original behaviour
        and propagate undefined values as usual.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pins</h2>

<dl>

    <dt>West edge, north end (input, bit width matches Data Bits attribute)</dt>
    <dd>The first of the two values to be compared.</dd>

    <dt>West edge, south end (input, bit width matches Data Bits attribute)</dt>
    <dd>The second of the two values to be compared.</dd>

    <dt>East edge, labeled <tt>&gt;</tt> (output, bit width 1)</dt>
    <dd>
        <code>1</code> if the first input is greater than the second input;
        <code>0</code> otherwise. This output propagates undefined values as
        described above.
    </dd>

    <dt>East edge, labeled <tt>=</tt> (output, bit width 1)</dt>
    <dd>
        Indicates whether the two inputs are equal. With <q>Strict Equality</q>
        set to <q>No</q>, any undefined or floating bits cause this output to
        become undefined. With <q>Strict Equality</q> set to <q>Yes</q>, the
        equality is evaluated even in the presence of undefined bits, and may
        still produce a definite <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.
    </dd>

    <dt>East edge, labeled <tt>&lt;</tt> (output, bit width 1)</dt>
    <dd>
        <code>1</code> if the first input is less than the second input;
        <code>0</code> otherwise. This output propagates undefined values as
        described above.
    </dd>

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When the component is selected or being added,
    Alt-0 through Alt-9 alter its <q>Data Bits</q> attribute.</p>

<dl>

    <dt>Data Bits</dt>
    <dd>The bit width of the component's inputs.</dd>

    <dt>Strict Equality</dt>
    <dd>
        Determines how the equality output reacts to undefined or floating bits.
        When set to <q>No</q>, any undefined bits force the equality output to
        become undefined, matching the original Logisim behaviour. When set to
        <q>Yes</q>, the comparator attempts to decide equality even in the
        presence of undefined bits, and treats the case where both operands are
        fully undefined as equal.
