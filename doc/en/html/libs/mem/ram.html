<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>
    The RAM component stores up to 16,777,216 values (as determined by the
    <q>Address Bit Width</q> attribute), each containing up to 32 bits
    (as determined by the <q>Data Bit Width</q> attribute).
    Circuits can read from and write to the memory, the user can edit
    individual locations with the Poke Tool, and the entire contents can
    be loaded or saved via the Menu Tool.
</p>

<p>
    Current contents are displayed inside the component.  Addresses are
    shown in gray to the left of the display area; data values are shown
    in hexadecimal.  The currently selected address is highlighted in
    inverse video (white on black).
</p>

<p>
    The RAM supports three different data interfaces, selected via the
    <q>Data Interface</q> attribute:
</p>

<dl>

    <dt>One synchronous load/store port (default)</dt>
    <dd>
        A single data port on the east side is used for both reading and
        writing.  The <var>ld</var> input selects the operation:
        when <var>ld</var> is 1 (or floating), the value at address
        <var>A</var> is driven onto the data port; when <var>ld</var> is 0,
        a clock event triggers a write of the value present on the data port.
    </dd>

    <dt>One asynchronous load/store port</dt>
    <dd>
        Similar to the previous interface, but without a clock input.
        Whenever <var>ld</var> is 0, the value on the data port is written
        immediately to the selected address, and any subsequent change in
        address or data while <var>ld</var> remains 0 produces another write.
    </dd>

    <dt>Separate load and store ports</dt>
    <dd>
        Two independent data ports are provided: a write port on the west
        side and a read port on the east side.  This avoids the need for
        explicit bus buffers and is often more convenient in complex designs.
    </dd>

</dl>

<p>
    For the synchronous interfaces, the moment at which writes occur is
    determined by the <q>Trigger</q> attribute, which interprets the clock
    input as rising edge, falling edge, high level or low level, in the
    same way as registers.  Writes occur only when the clock satisfies
    the configured trigger and the RAM is enabled.
</p>

<p>
    If the <q>Asynchronous Clear Pin</q> attribute is set to <q>Yes</q>,
    the component includes a <var>clr</var> input.  When this input is 1,
    all memory locations are forced to 0 immediately, regardless of the
    clock, load/store control or data interface.  When the attribute is
    set to <q>No</q>, the clear pin is omitted and the RAM has no global
    asynchronous reset.
</p>

<h2>Pins</h2>

<dl>

    <dt><var>A</var> on west edge (input, bit width matches Address Bit Width)</dt>
    <dd>
        Selects which memory location is currently accessed.
    </dd>

    <dt><var>D</var> on west edge (input, bit width matches Data Bit Width)</dt>
    <dd>
        Present only for the <q>Separate load and store ports</q> interface.
        When a store is requested, the value on this port is written into
        memory at address <var>A</var>.
    </dd>

    <dt><var>D</var> on east edge (input/output or output, bit width matches Data Bit Width)</dt>
    <dd>
        For interfaces with a single load/store port, this pin is bidirectional:
        it carries data being read from or written to memory depending on
        <var>ld</var> and the clock.  For the <q>Separate load and store
        ports</q> interface, it is a read-only output that presents the value
        stored at address <var>A</var> whenever the chip is enabled.
    </dd>

    <dt><var>str</var> on south edge (input, bit width 1)</dt>
    <dd>
        Store control (only for <q>Separate load and store ports</q>):
        when 1 or floating, a valid clock event stores the data from the
        west-side <var>D</var> input into memory, provided <var>sel</var> is
        also active.
    </dd>

    <dt><var>sel</var> on south edge (input, bit width 1)</dt>
    <dd>
        Chip select: enables or disables the RAM.  When 0, the component
        ignores clock events and does not drive the data output.
    </dd>

    <dt>Triangle on south edge (input, bit width 1)</dt>
    <dd>
        Clock input (absent for the asynchronous interface).
        Writes are triggered according to the <q>Trigger</q> attribute
        (rising edge, falling edge, high level or low level), provided
        the RAM is selected and <var>ld</var>/<var>str</var> indicate a store.
    </dd>

    <dt><var>ld</var> on south edge (input, bit width 1)</dt>
    <dd>
        Load control: when 1 or undefined, the RAM drives the value at the
        selected address onto the data output; when 0, it enables stores
        according to the current interface and clock configuration.
    </dd>

    <dt><var>clr</var> on south edge (input, bit width 1)</dt>
    <dd>
        Asynchronous clear (present only if <q>Asynchronous Clear Pin</q> is
        <q>Yes</q>): when 1, all locations in memory are immediately forced to
        0, regardless of other inputs.
    </dd>

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>
    When the component is selected or being added, the digits
    <code>0</code> through <code>9</code> alter its
    <q>Address Bit Width</q> attribute, and Alt-0 through Alt-9 alter its
    <q>Data Bit Width</q> attribute.
</p>

<dl>

    <dt>Address Bit Width</dt>
    <dd>
        The width of the address bus.  The RAM stores
        2<sup><var>addrBitWidth</var></sup> locations.
    </dd>

    <dt>Data Bit Width</dt>
    <dd>
        The width of each memory location.
    </dd>

    <dt>Data Interface</dt>
    <dd>
        Selects which of the three interfaces (single synchronous port,
        single asynchronous port, or separate load/store ports) is used.
    </dd>

    <dt>Trigger</dt>
    <dd>
        For synchronous interfaces, determines how the clock input is
        interpreted:
        <q>rising edge</q>, <q>falling edge</q>, <q>high level</q> or
        <q>low level</q>.  Has no effect when using the asynchronous interface.
    </dd>

    <dt>Asynchronous Clear Pin</dt>
    <dd>
        When set to <q>Yes</q>, the RAM includes a <var>clr</var> input that
        clears all memory locations asynchronously.  When set to <q>No</q>,
        this pin is omitted.
    </dd>
