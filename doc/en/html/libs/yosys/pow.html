<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>
    The Exponent component computes an integer power between two
    multi-bit operands and emits the result on its output.
    It is intended to emulate the behavior of the Yosys
    <code>$pow</code> cell (operator <code>**</code>) so that
    designs synthesized from SystemVerilog can be imported without
    changing their arithmetic semantics.
</p>

<p>
    The west side of the component has two inputs:
    <var>A</var>, the base, and <var>B</var>, the exponent.
    The east side has one output, <var>Y</var>, which carries the
    value <code>A ** B</code> interpreted according to the selected
    signedness mode.
</p>

<p>
    All three ports share the same bit width, defined by the
    <q>Data Bits</q> attribute.
    The computation is performed within this width; if the exact
    mathematical result does not fit, the high-order bits are
    discarded and only the least significant bits are kept,
    matching the usual behavior of fixed-width arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
    The <q>Signedness</q> attribute controls how the operands are
    interpreted:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Unsigned:</strong> <var>A</var>, <var>B</var> and
        <var>Y</var> are treated as unsigned integers.</li>
    <li><strong>Signed:</strong> operands are interpreted as
        two's-complement signed values.</li>
    <li><strong>Auto-detect Signedness:</strong> the component
        infers whether to use signed or unsigned arithmetic based
        on the most significant bit (MSB) of the operands, in a
        way compatible with the conventions used by Yosys.</li>
    <li><strong>Controlled by pin (if available):</strong> when
        this mode is selected, an additional control input can be
        used to switch between signed and unsigned interpretation
        at run time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When the exponent <var>B</var> is zero and the base is a
    defined value, the output is <code>1</code> (with the
    appropriate width). If the inputs contain undefined
    (<em>X</em>) or floating (<em>Z</em>) bits that prevent
    determining a consistent result, the output becomes
    <em>X</em>.

<h2>Pins</h2>

<dl>

    <dt>West edge, labeled <var>Base</var> (input, width = Data Bits)</dt>
    <dd>
        Base of the exponentiation. Its bit width is determined by
        the <q>Data Bits</q> attribute and its interpretation
        (signed/unsigned) depends on the <q>Signedness</q> setting.
    </dd>

    <dt>West edge, labeled <var>Exponent</var> (input, width = Data Bits)</dt>
    <dd>
        Exponent of the operation. Must be an integer value; the
        component uses only the lower bits according to
        <q>Data Bits</q>. Undefined or invalid values may produce
        an undefined (<em>X</em>) result.
    </dd>

    <dt>East edge, labeled <var>Y</var> (output, width = Data Bits)</dt>
    <dd>
        Result of the exponentiation <code>A ** B</code>, truncated
        to the configured bit width.
    </dd>

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<dl>

    <dt>Data Bits</dt>
    <dd>
        Bit width of the inputs <var>A</var>, <var>B</var> and the
        output <var>Y</var>. All arithmetic is performed within this
        fixed width.
    </dd>

    <dt>Signedness</dt>
    <dd>
        Controls how the component interprets its operands:
        <ul>
            <li><q>Unsigned</q>: all ports are treated as unsigned.</li>
            <li><q>Signed</q>: all ports are treated as two's-complement signed.</li>
            <li><q>Auto-detect Signedness</q>: the component selects a
                signed or unsigned interpretation in a way compatible
                with Yosys' internal rules.</li>
            <li><q>Decide on pin</q> (if present): the sign mode is
                chosen at simulation time based on an external input.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
